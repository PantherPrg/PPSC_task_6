# PPSC_task_6: Validating Passwords
**| difficulty: 3/10 |**

When creating a new account for your new website, you are required to enter a new email, username, and password. There are also requirements/constraints to be met for your new password. Only letters, numbers, underscores, and periods are allowed. It must be at least 7 characters long but not more than 25 characters long. Should require at least 1 capital letter and 1 number. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Input**:
You are given the attempted password as a string. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Output**:
Return "valid" if the password meets requirements and "invalid" if the password does not. Make sure to add a newline at the end of your returned answer. This is needed to match the format for the task result.

**optional challenge: write your code in under 50 lines**

This problem deals with if statements, arrays (depends on how you solve this problem), and ascii table conversion (depends on how you solve this problem). 

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blattner, or any other staff member for assistance. If multiple people have the same obstacles, we would be able to go over them during the club. 

Otherwise, you can use https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_if_statement.asp for if statements, https://www.tutsmake.com/python-split-a-string-into-array-of-characters-space/ to convert strings to arrays, and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4387138/pythonascii-character-decimal-representation-conversion and http://www.asciitable.com/ for ascii conversion (not needed, just really efficient).
